# designingAProgram
A program must be designed before they are written 

Program Development Cycle 
=
1. Design the program.
2. Write the code.
3. Correct syntax error. 
4. Test the program. 

How to understand the task that a program should be perfoming 
= 
1. Work with customers to get a sense of of what a program is suppose to do. 
2. Ask question about program details.
3. Create one or more software requirement. 

How to determine the steps that must be taken to perform the task
= 
1. Breakdown reqired task. 
2. Create an algorith, listting logical steps that must be taken. 

**Algorith** is set of well defined logical steps that must be taken to perform a task. 

**Pseudocode** fake code, informal language that has no syntax rule. It's used to create model program. 

**Flowchart** are diagram that graphically depicts the steps in the program. 
- **Oval** are terminal symbols
- **Parrallelgram** are input and output symbols
- **Rectangle** are processing symbls.
- Symbols are connected by arrows that represent the flow of the program.
